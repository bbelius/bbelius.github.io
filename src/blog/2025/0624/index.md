### How to Create This Website

Curious how far AI has come, I decided to build this site by prompting an AI agent through the entire process.

I gave it structure and intent — it handled most of the implementation. Total cost? ~$15 and less than a day's work (mostly researching legal requirements).

Final touches were made by hand mostly because it was faster than writing another prompt. Some minor visual changes were also done by me to fix alignment issues or to improve the overall look.

### How it works

!workflow stepbystep
1. Setup VSCode
Install VSCode and the RooCode extension. Create an OpenRouter API key (or any provider you prefer) and configure RooCode with it and the AI model(s) you want to use.

2. AI-Assisted Development
Prompt RooCode to generate code, refactor existing code, and/or implement complex features with natural language instructions.
Choose the AI Model that best fits your needs (Google's Gemini works great for large projects).

3. Iterative Refinement
Continuously refine and improve through AI collaboration and/or manual intervention, testing different approaches and optimizing for performance and aesthetics.

4. Polish & Deploy
Fine-tune the final product, clean up the code, and deploy the finished website.
You want to keep the technical debt low, so monitor what the AI does and guide it.
