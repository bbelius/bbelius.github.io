### About Me

Hi, I'm Ben - independent IT Consultant and Software Architect based in Germany.
Currently, I consult primarily for [Vienna Symphonic Library](https://www.vsl.co.at/), modernizing infrastructure that empowers musicians to bring their creative visions to life.

With a background spanning software development, DevOps, architecture, and team-leadership, I'm passionate about solving complex problems with elegant, pragmatic solutions.

I believe the best tech teams are built on clarity, trust, and transparency.
With these principles I want to enable teams to build things that matter, while actually enjoying the process.
